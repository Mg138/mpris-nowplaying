# mpris-nowplaying

A websocket based [MPRIS2](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/) "now-playing" / status client.

Main application is embedding a now-playing dock in your streams, but it isn't limited to that.

Written in Rust.

**Default bound IP is 127.0.0.1:32100**

## Why?

Iunno, the Media Session doesn't seem to work for us, maybe it uses MPRIS1, we have no idea the difference.

We wanted to have a Now Playing thing in our stream (via OBS) aligned to what's playing in our media player.

## Example HTML

Look in `/examples`.

## API

The returned message from the bound WebSocket address is similar to that of a [Media Session](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaSession) JSON.

However, there's some additional information: (only marking additions!)

```
"mediaSession": {
    "metadata": {
        "length": u64, // unit: microseconds, the media's length in time
    }
    "position": u64 // unit: microseconds, the current playback position
}
```
